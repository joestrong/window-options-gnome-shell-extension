The window options extension uses translations from the Mutter domain.
Huge kudos to all the translators who contributed to that!

There are also some additional translations for strings not in Mutter, and they
 live here (like 'Raise', 'Lower', ...)

**Help is needed to translate these few extra strings!**

If you think you can help out, then copy TEMPLATE.po to <your_language_code>.po
 and add the appropriate translations.
Also add your language code to the LINGUAS file.

Then to have it take affect, run the 'make_translations' script.

Then email the new .po file to me at <mathematical.coffee@gmail.com> and I'll
 include it in the distribution!

Also include yourself in the CREDITS below (you deserve it)!
